helm wasn't available for me so I had to rerun the ./get_helm.sh script and then it started working.

Will this always happen with a new session?

Hi Daniel-

It will happen if the VM running your google cloud shell gets restarted for some reason.  This is generally uncommon, I have not yet determined why or how it sometimes gets restarted.
